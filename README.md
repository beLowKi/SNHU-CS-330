# Response questions

- How do I approach designing software

I prefer the iterative approach to software design--designing individual features rather than the whole thing at once.
We learned about this Agile-esque method in a previous course, and it feels the most natural to me. I like treating
programs as bundles of seperate features. In the future, I could turn this mentality into a more formal design stage.
  
- Dow do I approach developing programs

I tend to develop programs incrementally at first--refining things later as I start to have a better idea of what the final software will look
like. Things like technical debt create this growing urge to refactor and redesign whenever possible, but that becomes cumbersome very fast.
I tend to develop a "rough draft" of a program first by treating the software requirements like a checklist: coding each one individually.
At the end, and maybe a few times along the way, I'll go back and refactor parts of my code after experiencing some of their weaknesses.
It's important to me to have some sort of minimum-viable program before trying to optimize it because I have a habit of getting
distracted by small details when coding.
  
- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals

Game development is one of the few things I'd say I'm really interested in, and computational graphics
have a huge role in it. Already, I've been using some of what I've learned in this course to better
understand the games I'm making. It's a lot of math, which is always helpful in computer science, plus
I'm taking a game development course next term. I'm not sure if I want to pursue professional game
development, but if I did, what I learned in this course will be really helpful. Things like coordinates,
rendering, shaders, and lighting are very important. OpenGL especially is a really useful tool to have.
